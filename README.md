# pywars
Pywars is a Guild Wars 2 API wrapper written in Python currently in production.

This wrapper is being developed for learning purposes to cover topics such as Python OOP, Rest APIs, and what a wrapper is.

Next three major development tasks:

1. split api_models into separate files for each api model

2. split get_requests into separate files for each type of get request (character, achievement, etc.)

3. Major documentation overhaul

4. Learn how to package a wrapper
